# codifyR - coding text to qualitative analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**Package under development !!**

Coding text, annotate text or text tagging in qualitative analysis means

> “Coding means that we attach labels to segments of data that depict what each segment is about. Through coding, we raise analytic questions about our data from […]. Coding distills data, sorts them, and gives us an analytic handle for making comparisons with other segments of data” (Charmaz, 2014:4).

> “Coding is the strategy that moves data from diffuse and messy text to organized ideas about what is going on” (Richards and Morse, 2013:167).

> "Coding is a core function in ATLAS.ti that lets you “tell” the software where the interesting things are in your data. ... the main goal of categorizing your data is to tag things to define or organize them. In the process of categorization, we compare data segments and look for similarities. All similar elements can be grouped under the same name. By naming something, we conceptualize and frame it at the same time" (Friese, 2019).

The goal of codifyR is to tag tex with categories.

![Exemple of text codified with {codifyR}](./vignettes/sotu_trump_ex2.png)

## Installation

You can install the development version of codifyR like so:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("SoaresAlisson/codifyR")
```



See the vignettes

## TODO - Future improvements

- option do add a brief quantitative description of the category, and words marked in the coded text or in a separated file.
- Use vector and list object as input to the text tagger
- import yaml file with dictionary of terms
- Make easier to pickup a color
- a live render with a shiny app
- Use Large Language Model, probably with {rollama}, helping to codify text.
